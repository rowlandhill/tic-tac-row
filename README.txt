Rowland's Tic-Tac-Tow README

This SPA uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  In its current state, it is not quite a SPA, since the reset 
button refreshes the page.  Eventually I would like to add Bootstrap to the technologies list.

Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
I began planning by drawing out a diagram of how I wanted the app to look.  It's not entirely there, but 
it was helpful to have a visual before I started building.
I then mapped out the steps that I would take to move the project forward, with a ton of help
from the provided "to do" list:
- Create a basic board with HTML and CSS
- Set up Authentications
- Build the engine, make sure it works, test for winners, make sure you can play a full game where a winner is declared
and no additional moves can be made.  Also, no ties or illegal moves.
- Connect the game to the backend
- Make it look good

Unsolved problems:
- Reset button refreshes page
- Scores are not displayed or linked to the game
- Certain functions that are displayed should be hidden
- Placement on the page is not ideal
- I would like it to look much better
- I would like to add some graphics and sounds

I wrote my user story on my computer:

User Story:

As a user, I want to be able to play tic tac toe.  I want to be able to create an account, so I can sign 
in and out with a password.

I would like to be able to change my password if I want.

I would like my record saved to my account, and I would like to see the rankings of the top 5-10 
users shown on the app, like an arcade.

I want to be able to click a button to start a new game without having to refresh the page.

Eventually, I want the starting playing to be randomized, and I would also like to be able to play 
a user on another computer.
